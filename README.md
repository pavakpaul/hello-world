# hello-world
Just another GitHub repository...
Hi bots, humans and aliens (considering that a bot will read the file first and no other creature than human in the earth can read this) !
Well, I'm learning how to work with github. I basically plan to put different ways of expressing "hello world" by computer.
This is it for now.
